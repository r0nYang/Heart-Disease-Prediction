# Heart Disease Prediction Using the K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm

This project is our attempt at building a model which predicts whether an individual is likely to have heart disease based on key health metrics. The prediction model is built using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm, and it focuses on three main variables: age, resting blood pressure, and cholesterol level.
